# Array Data Structure

## Overview
Array is an ordered colection of items
Arrays are stored in sequence of computer memory location

## Operations
Algorithms that process data stored as arrays will typically need to visit systematically all the items in the array, and apply
appropriate operations on them.

Refer [this article](https://medium.com/codeconvention/learn-array-data-structure-2fa01edd21c2) for operations of Arrays and their time complexity

## To consider
Advantage:

Reading Elements from an array is Fast and efficient.
Adding an element into an array is fast.
And Array is the foundation of many data structures.

Disadvantage:

Linear Complexity at the time of insertion and deletion
The Array has a fixed size (not talking about Dynamic Array and Python and Javascript like languages)
