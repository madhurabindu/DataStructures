# Stacks Data Structure

## Overview
Stack is an ordered list of similar data type.
Stacks are dynamic data structures that follow the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. The last item to be inserted into a stack is the first one to be deleted from it.
- Dynamic data structures
- Size of stack changes with each  and  operation. Each  and  operation increases and decreases the size of the stack by , respectively.
- Stack is said to be in Overflow state when it is completely full and is said to be in Underflow state if it is completely empty
## Operations

- Push Operation : O(1)
- Pop Operation : O(1)
- Top Operation : O(1)
- Search Operation : O(n)
